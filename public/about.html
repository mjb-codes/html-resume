    <p>Hi! I'm Mike, appreciate you being here.</p>
    <p>I've worked in the entertainment for over a decade, beginning in the music industry where I worked in digital sales for an international music distributor in London.</p>
    <p>Following this I took the oppourtunity to move to Melbourne, Australia for a brief period, where I began my journey as a freelancer, creating my own record label and working with a local act to promote their debut release</p>
    <p>After a brief period travelling in South East Asia (that photo above was taken in an incredible bamboo forest in Japan), I returned the UK and began working with a burgeoning immersive events startup, who now run multiple productions across theatres internationally, with I being a major part of their marketing systems setup.</p>
    <p>Now based in vibrant South Birmingham, I'm utilising my skills to become a full-time developer. You can see some more examples of my work <a href="">here</a>, and if you want to talk more please <a href="">reach out!</a></p>
